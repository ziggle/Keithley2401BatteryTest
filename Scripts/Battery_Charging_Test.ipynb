    "The battery specification does not contain a discharge profile, which is unusual.The battery characteristics critical to charging are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Li-Ion Chemistry\n",
    "* 500 mAh Capacity (4.2 V â†’ 3.0 V, 0.2 C normalized discharge current)\n",
    "* 4.2 V Charge Voltage\n",

    "## Genesis Charging Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The charger implements the following charge profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constant Current Mode\n",
    "    * 247 mA\n",
    "    * V<sub>BAT</sub>3.0V - 4.1V\n",
